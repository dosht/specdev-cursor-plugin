# SpecDev Extension Requirements

## Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for the SpecDev VS Code extension, which implements a Kiro-style workflow for specification development. The extension provides a structured approach to managing requirements, design documentation, and tasks in a single interface.

## Requirements

### REQ-001: Three-Tab Interface
**User Story:** As a developer, I want a three-tab interface (Requirements, Design, Tasks), so that I can organize my project specifications in a structured manner.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN I open SpecDev THEN I SHALL see three tabs: Requirements, Design, and Tasks
2. WHEN I click on any tab THEN the corresponding content SHALL be displayed
3. WHEN I switch between tabs THEN the content SHALL be preserved

### REQ-002: Markdown Support
**User Story:** As a technical writer, I want to write content in Markdown format, so that I can use familiar syntax for documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN I enter Markdown syntax THEN it SHALL be properly rendered in preview mode
2. WHEN I switch to edit mode THEN I SHALL see the raw Markdown text
3. WHEN I save content THEN it SHALL be stored as Markdown files

### REQ-003: Mermaid Diagram Support
**User Story:** As a software architect, I want to create Mermaid diagrams in the Design tab, so that I can visualize system architecture and data flows.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN I write Mermaid syntax in code blocks THEN diagrams SHALL be rendered
2. WHEN I use the Design tab THEN Mermaid rendering SHALL be enabled
3. WHEN I create flowcharts or sequence diagrams THEN they SHALL display correctly

### REQ-004: Interactive Task Checkboxes
**User Story:** As a project manager, I want interactive checkboxes for tasks, so that I can track completion status.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN I use checkbox syntax in the Tasks tab THEN checkboxes SHALL be interactive
2. WHEN I click a checkbox THEN the underlying Markdown SHALL be updated
3. WHEN tasks are completed THEN they SHALL appear with strikethrough text

### REQ-005: File Storage in .specdev Folder
**User Story:** As a developer, I want specifications stored in a .specdev folder, so that I can version control or ignore them as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN I save content THEN files SHALL be stored in .specdev/requirements.md, .specdev/design.md, .specdev/tasks.md
2. WHEN the .specdev folder doesn't exist THEN it SHALL be created automatically
3. WHEN I save content THEN I SHALL receive confirmation feedback

### REQ-006: VS Code Integration
**User Story:** As a VS Code user, I want the extension to integrate seamlessly with my editor, so that I can access it through standard VS Code UI patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN I install the extension THEN it SHALL appear in the Command Palette
2. WHEN I right-click in Explorer THEN I SHALL see "Open SpecDev" option
3. WHEN I use the extension THEN it SHALL follow VS Code theming conventions
